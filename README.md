INTRODUCTORY MATHEMATICAL   MODELLING
2024-25   1st   SEMESTER   FINAL   PROJECT
BACHELOR DEGREE - YEAR   1
REQUIREMENT OF FINAL PROJECTThe students work in teams on certain practical problems with knowledge mainly from   one   of the   following   or   related   areas   for   mathematical   modelling,   then   present   their   outcomes in final reports and posters.
(a). Data visualisation, data fitting, and linear regression.
(b).    Time    series    analysis,    in    particular,    autoregressive    integrated    moving      average   (ARIMA) models.
(c). Graph theory, in particular, shortest path and minimum spanning tree.
(d). Linear programming, in particular, simplex method.
DESCRIPTION OF FINAL PROJECT
(1).   The   duration   from   the   release   date   to   the   due   date   is   6   weeks,   for   example,   18   November   - 30 December   2024, or   any   other   equivalent   period.
(2). Students are free to find classmates to form. teams, each typically consisting of   3 to 6 members.
(3).    Every    student      team      designates      a      team      leader,      responsible      for      the      duties      of   communication, submission, etc.
(4).   Every team   find   one   or   several related practical problems   worthy   of study   and   of appropriate   level   regarding   the   academic   background   of   the   team   members.
(5). The practical problems could be   adapted from reliable resources, such as problems   from   previous   mathematical   contests   in   modelling,   e.g.,   MCM/ICM,   CUMCM,   from   textbooks   or   reference   books,   or   could   be   designed   by   the   team   members   themselves out   of   consideration   of   the   real   world   around   them.
(6).   The practical problems   should be   solved mainly   with   the   theories   and   techniques   in the aforementioned areas for mathematical modelling.
(7).   The   relevant   computation   could   be    fulfilled   with    any   computer   programming   language   or   software   /   application / program   in   which   they   are   skilled,   not   limited   to   Matlab or Python.
(8). The team members are   suggested to take   different   roles   for   different   tasks   such   as   modelling,   programming,   and   writing,   and   meanwhile   cooperate   closely   with   each   other.
(9). The outcomes ought to be demonstrated in   a   final report   and   a poster, both written   in English.
(10). The final reports and posters be marked according to criteria in modelling, results,   and writing, respectively.
(11).   The   contribution   of each   team   member   be   reviewed   and   graded   by   every   other   member in the team. We call the results peer marks.
(12).   For   each   student,   this   Final   Project   contributes   65%   to   the   overall   mark   of the   module MTH020. The final report contributes 50% to the mark of   the Final Project, the   poster 30%, and the average peer mark 20%. Support files   ought to be   submitted   at   the   sametime, although carrying no marks. More details are in the Marking Scheme below.
(13).   The   final   report   and   poster   could   be   produced   with    software   /   application   /   program   such   as Microsoft   Office Word, PowerPoint,   a LaTeX typesetting   system,   or   the   like.   There   are   LaTeX   distributions   MiKTeX   under   Windows,   MacTeX   under   macOS,   TeX Live under Unix代 写MTH020 INTRODUCTORY MATHEMATICAL MODELLING 2024-25Python

But,                the             website   https://www.overleaf.com/seems   particularly   easy   to   use   for   beginners.
(14).   The   format   of the   final   report   ought   to   be   a   PDF   document   of A4   paper   size,   portrait   orientation,   suitable   font,   font   size,   margins,   line   and   paragraph   spacing,   etc.   There   is   no   limit   of   number   of   pages.

(19).   Existent templates   from various resources may be   used   for   your   final   report   and   poster,   and   award-winning   papers   of prestigious   mathematical   contests   in   modelling   could   betaken   as   exemplars.
(20). Generative artificial intelligence (AI) tools, such as   ChatGPT, Microsoft   Copilot,   are    allowed    to   use    in   knowledge    learning,    reference    searching,    resource    locating,   content    polishing,    programming      code      generating,      and      so      forth.      But,      (i)      explicit   declaration should be made in any part done   aided   with   AI,   (ii)   websites   and   names   of   AI tools should be clearly included in the references part, and   (iii) the   entire record   for   the   sessions of   dialogues with the AI tools   should be completely   appended to   the   final   report, after   the   appendix   of   programming   code.
(21).   At   different    stages    of   the    Final   Project,   the   module    examiner   will    send    out   announcements   via   email   from   the   Learning   Mall   Core.   More   instructions   will   be   provided   for   technical   steps   such   as   grouping   students   into   teams,   collection   of peer   marks, submission   of   final   reports   and   posters, etc.
(22). Outstanding   posters   maybe   printed   out   for   public   display   to   a   broader   audience.
(23). Any violation of   academic integrity will result in penalties and demerit points.
